\section{State of the art}

Regarding to smart cities' apps that use user generated content, we highlight the following works. Urbanopoly \cite{celino_urbanopolysocial_2012} presents an app for smartphones which combines Human Computation, \textit{gamification} and Linked Open Data to verify, correct and collect data about tourism venues. To achieve this, Urbanopoly offers different games to the users, like quizzes, photo taking, etc. Similar to Urbanopoly, we can find Urbanmatch \cite{celino_urbanmatch-linking_2012}. Urbanmatch presents a game in which the user takes photos about some tourism venues, to be published as Linked Open Data by the system. Another work that uses Human Computation for movie-related data curation is Linked Movei Quiz\footnote{\url{http://lamboratory.com/hacks/ldmq/}}.
