\section{Use cases}
\label{sec:use_cases}

To illustrate the semantic representation of trust and provenance data, two use cases are presented: 311 Bilbao and AirQual Madrid.

\subsection{311 Bilbao}
\label{subsec:311}

311 Bilbao, uses Linked Open Data to get an overview of reports of faults in public infrastructure. From the data ownerâ€™s point of view, enrichment of their datasets by third parties, such as users of the 311 Bilbao application, revealed two problems: 1) the fact that data does not need to be approved before being published and that there is no mechanism to control the amount of data a citizen can add and 2) there is still the need for a way to differentiate the default trustworthiness of the different authors such as citizens and city councils. At the following triples, the representation of the provenance of a user generated report is shown:
